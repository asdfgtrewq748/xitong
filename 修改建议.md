Enhancing Visualization and Functionality for Research-Grade Outputs

To make the 智能矿业工程系统 truly assist scientific research, the core features should be optimized for high-quality visualization and practical research utility. Below are detailed suggestions for each major module (geological modeling, rock mechanics database, theoretical calculations, and scientific plotting) focusing on functional improvements that yield publication-ready outputs.

1. High-Quality Scientific Plotting (科研绘图)

Upgrade Plot Aesthetics and Export – Ensure that all 2D charts (line plots, scatter plots, histograms, etc.) are rendered in publication quality. This involves:

Higher Resolution & Vector Formats: Allow exporting figures at 300+ DPI and in vector formats (SVG/PDF/EPS) so they remain crisp in print
GitHub
GitHub
. Many journals require ~300 DPI for images (and up to 600 DPI for fine detailed line art) as well as vector formats for line drawings
GitHub
. The system should provide one-click export to PNG (for quick use) and SVG/PDF for journal submission
GitHub
. This guarantees that charts can be used directly in papers without quality loss.

Journal-Standard Sizing: Implement preset figure sizes that match common journal layouts (e.g. single-column ~85–90 mm width, double-column ~170–180 mm)
GitHub
GitHub
. By adopting standard figure dimensions and aspect ratios, the plots will fit nicely into publication templates. For example, Nature’s single-column width is ~89 mm and Science’s ~90 mm
GitHub
GitHub
. Providing these presets (and enforcing appropriate aspect ratios) will make it easier for researchers to insert figures into papers at the correct scale.

Improved Styling (Fonts, Colors, Lines): Use professional-looking fonts and line styles by default. Increase axis label and title fonts to a readable size (e.g. ~18 pt for labels, ~24 pt for titles, depending on final figure size)
fraserlab.com
, and choose universal fonts like Arial or Times New Roman as required by many journals
GitHub
GitHub
. Ensure lines and markers are thick enough (minimum ~0.5–1 pt line weight
GitHub
) to be clearly visible when printed. Turn on anti-aliasing for smoother lines. Adopting a modern color palette (avoiding the default harsh colors) is important – for instance, use a colorblind-friendly or pastel color cycle so that multiple series are distinguishable but not garish
fraserlab.com
. Fewer than ~8 distinct colors is recommended for clarity
GitHub
.

Refined Axes and Grid: Configure axes and grids for a clean look. Use outward-facing tick marks and sufficient padding so labels don’t clutter the plot
fraserlab.com
. Minor gridlines can be added in a light gray behind data to guide the eye without overwhelming the plot
fraserlab.com
. Also, ensure axis labels include units and use consistent number formatting (e.g. appropriate use of scientific notation or decimals) for professionalism. All these tweaks contribute to a “polished” appearance comparable to Origin’s defaults
fraserlab.com
fraserlab.com
.

Templates & One-Click Styles: Provide predefined “styles” or themes (possibly labeled by journal names or presentation vs. publication) that apply these settings. For example, a “SCI Journal Mode” could automatically set the figure to 300 DPI, appropriate font sizes, color scheme, etc., based on chosen journal guidelines
GitHub
GitHub
. This reduces manual adjustments – users can generate a plot and trust it meets publication standards. The system can also give suggestions or warnings for plot design (e.g. too many colors or an overly long title) to nudge users toward clearer figures
GitHub
GitHub
.

Examples & Comparison: It might help to include an example gallery of a “before vs after” for a sample plot – showing how a default plot can be transformed into a publication-quality plot with the system’s enhancements. This will build user confidence that the built-in plotting can replace external tools like Origin. The key is that after these improvements, users should be able to take a figure output and paste it into a paper with minimal or no touch-ups needed.

2. 3D Geological Modeling Visualization

Make 3D Models More Insightful and Usable for Research. Currently, the geological modeling module can build 3D block models, but to increase its research value, consider the following functional enhancements:

Cross-Section and Slicing Tools: Enable users to cut geological cross-sections through the 3D model and view those 2D slices. This is crucial for geology research, as cross-sections reveal the internal structure along a plane. For instance, a user could define a vertical plane at a certain location and the software would produce the cross-section profile (with proper scale and labels). This 2D output should be high-quality and exportable as an image for publications. Adding a slicing tool will allow generating multiple cross-sections (e.g., along different azimuths or through key boreholes) without needing external CAD software
GitHub
.

Multiple Rendering Modes: Implement various visualization styles for the 3D model. In addition to the current solid surface rendering, allow wireframe or translucent modes to see hidden layers, and textured or color-coded surfaces by property (e.g., different rock types in different colors). Wireframe can be useful in papers to show the structure clearly without full opacity, and transparency can illustrate overlapping features. Providing a toggle for these modes, as well as lighting/rotation controls, will make the models more illustrative. For example, a figure could show a semi-transparent overburden to reveal an ore body beneath. These options help create publication-ready 3D illustrations directly from the software
GitHub
.

Layer Filtering and Emphasis: If the model contains multiple geological layers or seams, allow users to selectively display certain layers or regions. For example, a checkbox list of geological units could let the user turn layers on/off. This way, one can focus the view and figures on the relevant parts (e.g., only the coal seams of interest, or highlight one layer in a different color while greying out others). Such filtering makes the resulting images more informative by removing unnecessary clutter
GitHub
. The system could also automatically apply distinct colors to each layer and provide a legend.

Quantitative Analysis Outputs: Make the 3D model actionable for research by computing metrics that researchers can use. For example, calculate the volume or thickness of each geological unit in the model, or the spatial extent, and present these as results (with an option to export the data). This turns a visual model into data that can support a paper’s claims (e.g. “the modeled coal seam has an estimated volume of X cubic meters”). Basic geostatistical analysis features like volume, area, or even mass (if density is given) can greatly increase the model’s utility for research
GitHub
. These values could be shown in a table or overlaid on the model (e.g., as annotations).

Model Export and Sharing: Provide a way to export the 3D model data (for instance as an industry-standard format like STL, OBJ, or a simple XYZ grid)
GitHub
. This allows researchers to import the model into other tools if needed or include supplementary files with publications. Even if the in-app visualization is good, the ability to share the raw model or load it in GIS/CAD software for further analysis can be valuable.

User Guidance and Annotation: To bridge the gap from model to paper figure, consider adding an annotation capability in the 3D view. Users could place labels or arrows on features (e.g., mark a fault line or a particular stratum) and then export the annotated image. This saves time in external drawing programs. Additionally, ensure the 3D view displays scale information (like a scale bar or axes with units) so that any exported figure has the necessary context.

By implementing these features, the geological modeling module goes from "just a pretty model" to a research tool. A researcher could include a figure of the 3D model (or a cross-section) in a publication and refer to quantitative results derived from it (like volumes, extents), which makes the model directly beneficial to their paper rather than just illustrative.

### Advanced SCI Paper-Ready Features for Geological Modeling

To elevate the geological modeling module to a publication-grade research tool suitable for high-impact SCI journals, consider implementing the following advanced capabilities:

**Uncertainty Quantification and Geostatistical Analysis**

- **Kriging Variance Mapping**: Beyond interpolating surfaces, compute and visualize kriging variance (uncertainty) for each grid point. This allows researchers to identify regions where predictions are less reliable due to sparse data coverage. A 2D heat map or 3D overlay showing uncertainty can be included in papers to demonstrate data confidence levels, which is crucial for rigorous scientific work. Many geology journals require authors to discuss interpolation uncertainty.

- **Cross-Validation Metrics**: Implement leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) for the interpolation method. Report metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R² to validate model accuracy. These statistics should be exportable as a table for inclusion in the methodology section of a paper. This demonstrates that the modeling approach is statistically sound.

- **Variogram Analysis Tools**: For Kriging interpolation, provide interactive variogram modeling (experimental variogram computation, model fitting with spherical/exponential/Gaussian models). Display fitted variogram parameters (nugget, sill, range) and allow users to adjust them. A well-documented variogram analysis is a cornerstone of geostatistical modeling papers and shows methodological rigor.

**Multi-Method Comparison Framework**

- **Side-by-Side Interpolation Comparison**: Allow users to run multiple interpolation methods (Kriging, IDW, Spline, Natural Neighbor) simultaneously on the same dataset and compare results visually (e.g., split-screen 3D views or overlaid contours). Compute goodness-of-fit metrics for each method to objectively select the best approach. This comparative analysis can form the basis of a methodology section showing why a particular method was chosen.

- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Implement parameter sensitivity testing—vary interpolation parameters (e.g., IDW power, Kriging search radius, grid resolution) and show how the model changes. Generate plots of model metrics (RMSE, volume estimates) vs. parameter values to identify optimal settings. This analysis can be published as supplementary material demonstrating robustness.

**Reproducibility and Metadata Tracking**

- **Automated Modeling Report**: Generate a comprehensive PDF/HTML report documenting the entire modeling workflow: input data summary (number of boreholes, spatial distribution, coordinate system), interpolation method and parameters used, quality metrics, model statistics (layer volumes, thickness statistics), and all export settings. This report can serve as supplementary material for journal submissions, ensuring full reproducibility.

- **Data Provenance Logging**: Track and export a complete audit trail of modeling steps (data import timestamps, parameter choices, software version, random seed for stochastic methods). Export this as a structured JSON or XML file that can be archived with published datasets (increasingly required by journals for data transparency).

**Advanced Geological Structure Analysis**

- **Structural Dip and Strike Calculation**: For each layer, compute apparent dip angles and strike directions from the interpolated surface. Visualize these as vector fields or rose diagrams overlaid on the 3D model. This quantitative structural geology analysis can be a paper contribution, especially if revealing tectonic patterns or depositional trends.

- **Isopach (Thickness) Mapping**: Generate high-quality 2D isopach maps showing thickness variation across the study area for each layer. Include contour lines, color ramps, and statistical annotations (min/max/mean thickness). These maps are standard figures in coal geology and petroleum geology papers.

- **Volume/Tonnage Estimation with Confidence Intervals**: Beyond simple volume calculation, provide confidence intervals based on interpolation uncertainty. Use Monte Carlo simulation or analytical error propagation to estimate volume ranges (e.g., "coal reserves: 2.5 ± 0.3 million cubic meters at 95% confidence"). This level of rigor is essential for resource estimation papers.

**Comparative Geology and Correlation Analysis**

- **Layer Correlation Diagrams**: Generate stratigraphic correlation panels (fence diagrams) showing how layers correlate between boreholes along user-defined transects. These classic geological diagrams are essential for papers discussing depositional environments or structural continuity.

- **Anomaly Detection**: Implement algorithms to detect and highlight geological anomalies (e.g., unusually thick/thin zones, discontinuities, potential faults). Use statistical methods (z-score analysis, spatial clustering) to flag regions of interest. Documenting these anomalies can form case studies or discussion points in papers.

**Integration with Numerical Simulation Results**

- **Post-Simulation Overlay**: Allow importing numerical simulation results (e.g., stress, displacement, plastic zones from FLAC3D) back into the geological model viewer. Overlay simulation results as color maps on the 3D model to show which geological units are most affected. This integration between modeling and analysis can demonstrate cause-effect relationships in papers.

- **Model-Data Coupling**: If the system runs mechanical simulations, compare predicted vs. observed behavior (e.g., subsidence measurements vs. model predictions). Generate residual maps and statistical comparisons. This validation workflow is crucial for papers claiming predictive capability.

**Publication-Quality Figure Generation**

- **Multi-View Layout**: Create publication-ready figure layouts combining plan view, cross-sections, and 3D perspective in a single composite figure with professional labeling, scale bars, north arrows, and legends. Export at 300+ DPI in TIFF or EPS format as per journal requirements.

- **Animation Export for Supplementary Materials**: Generate flythrough animations or layer-by-layer build-up sequences as videos (MP4/GIF) for supplementary materials. Many modern journals accept video supplements, and animations can effectively communicate 3D spatial relationships that static figures cannot.

**Data Sharing and Open Science Compliance**

- **Standardized Data Formats**: Export not just 3D models but also the underlying data (borehole logs, interpolated grids) in community-standard formats (GeoTIFF for rasters, GSLib/CSV for point data, GeoPackage for vector data). This facilitates data sharing and compliance with open data mandates from funding agencies and publishers.

- **FAIR Principles Compliance**: Structure exports to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). Include README files with dataset descriptions, coordinate reference system metadata, and usage guidelines. This preparation makes datasets publishable in data journals or repositories (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare).

**Advanced Research Scenarios**

- **Time-Series Geological Modeling**: For multi-temporal datasets (e.g., repeated surveys or historical data), enable time-series modeling showing geological changes over time (subsidence evolution, aquifer depletion). Generate time-lapse visualizations and trend analysis plots suitable for dynamic system studies.

- **Probability and Risk Mapping**: For resource assessment, calculate probability of occurrence maps (e.g., probability that coal thickness exceeds a threshold) based on kriging probabilities. Generate risk maps for mining planning. These probabilistic approaches are increasingly expected in modern resource geology papers.

By implementing these SCI-oriented features, the geological modeling module transforms into a complete research platform capable of supporting publications in top-tier journals like *Engineering Geology*, *International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences*, *Computers & Geosciences*, or *Journal of Geophysical Research*. The key is providing not just visualization, but quantitative analysis, uncertainty assessment, reproducibility, and publication-ready outputs that meet the rigorous standards of peer-reviewed scientific literature.

3. Rock Mechanics Database & Data Analysis

Turn the rock mechanics database into a research data analytics tool. The database of rock mechanical properties is potentially very valuable for discovering trends or validating assumptions. Right now, the UI shows an overview (total samples, distribution by province, etc.)
GitHub
GitHub
. To better support research:

Advanced Data Visualization: Add interactive charts and plots to reveal patterns in the data. For example, include the ability to plot histograms of key properties (uniaxial compressive strength, tensile strength, Young’s modulus, etc.) to see their distribution. A researcher might want to know if the strength data follows a log-normal distribution or if there are outliers – a histogram or boxplot can show this at a glance. Similarly, implement scatter plots for any two variables in the database (with trend lines or correlation coefficients) so users can explore relationships (e.g., between porosity and strength, or depth and RMR index). These visual analyses can directly feed into research findings (e.g. showing a correlation graph in a paper).

Filtering and Grouping: Allow users to filter the dataset by criteria (such as lithology type, location, depth range, etc.) and see summary statistics or charts for the subset. For instance, one could filter the database to only “sandstone” samples and then view the average and range of strength for sandstones. This is useful for comparing different rock types or regions. The interface might include a simple query builder or predefined filters (by province, by rock type, by mine). After filtering, the core statistics (count, min, max, mean, standard deviation) for relevant properties should update, and charts should reflect the filtered data. This dynamic analysis helps researchers quickly test hypotheses like “Rock type A is generally stronger than type B”.

Geographical Visualization Enhancements: The existing map of sample distribution by province is helpful
GitHub
GitHub
. We can enhance it by allowing different map views, such as coloring provinces by the average value of a chosen property (instead of just count). For example, a heat map of average rock strength by region could be insightful. Also, allow zooming into a province or plotting data points on a map if coordinate data exists for samples (to see spatial variation within a province). Geospatial visualization can reveal trends (like stronger rock in one area vs another) which could be publishable findings in a geology or geotech context.

Data Export & Reporting: Provide easy export of any filtered dataset or analysis result (CSV or Excel for data, image/PDF for charts). This way, if the user creates a specific chart or discovers a pattern, they can quickly save the figure for use in a paper or export the underlying data to include in supplementary material. Possibly implement a “Generate Report” feature that compiles selected statistics and charts into a PDF report. This could include a summary of the database query, the plots generated, and any notes, serving as a quick way to share results with colleagues or include in documentation.

Integration with Theoretical Models: A powerful addition could be to let the user pick data from the database to feed into calculations or models. For example, if the database has rock strength parameters, allow the tunnel support calculator (from the theoretical module) to pull typical values for a given rock type. This ensures consistency between empirical data and theoretical analysis. It also means the database isn’t just static; it actively informs other parts of the system, which is highly useful in research (e.g., using real data ranges in designs).

By transforming the database module into an interactive data analysis dashboard, the system will help researchers derive new insights from their data. Instead of exporting to external tools like Excel or SPSS for analysis, they can do exploratory analysis on the fly. The visualizations and statistical results can directly be used in conference presentations or journal articles, demonstrating the practical scientific value of the software.

4. Theoretical Calculations (Analytical Tools) Visualization

Bridge the gap between raw calculations and insightful visualization. The system’s theoretical calculations (e.g., tunnel support design formulas, rock mechanics theory computations) currently produce numeric outputs for given inputs
GitHub
. To better support research and understanding:

Illustrative Diagrams: Create diagram outputs for key theoretical results. For example, in the tunnel support module, when a user computes the plastic zone radius (R) and loosening zone (hct, hcs) for a tunnel, the software could generate a simple schematic of a tunnel cross-section showing these zones as colored regions. The diagram could depict the tunnel with an envelope around it representing R, and arrows indicating the height of the loosening zone in the roof (hct) and sides (hcs). Such a figure can be directly used in a paper or presentation to illustrate the concepts, instead of just quoting numbers. Essentially, accompany the numbers with a visual context so researchers can communicate the meaning easily. This turns abstract results into an explanatory figure.

Parametric Plots: Often in research, one is interested in how an output changes with a parameter. The software can add a feature to plot theoretical formulas as a function of one variable. For instance, plot the plastic zone radius R versus tunnel depth H (keeping other inputs constant) to see how sensitivity to depth looks. Or plot factor of safety versus support density, etc., depending on available formulas. If the user provides a range or if multiple calculations are done (the batch calculation functionality could be repurposed), the system could automatically generate a graph of the results. For example, after a batch run with varying inputs, allow selecting any two fields (input or output) to generate an X–Y scatter or line plot. This way, if a researcher ran a parametric study (varying one parameter), they get a ready plot of the outcome. These plots are very useful in papers to demonstrate trends (e.g., “Figure: Relationship between tunnel depth and plastic zone radius for various rock strengths…”).

Result Comparison and Validation: If there are theoretical models and perhaps experimental data (from the database) to compare, allow overlaying data points on theoretical curves. For instance, if the theoretical calculation predicts how rock strength scales with confining pressure, and the database has some experimental points, the software could plot both on the same axes. This directly helps in research by validating models against data. It also produces publication-quality graphs that combine theory and experiment – something that often has to be done manually otherwise.

Enhanced Output Tables: When numerical results are unavoidable (and they often are for design calculations), format them in a clear, publication-ready table. The system can output a LaTeX or CSV table of results with proper headings and units, which the researcher can drop into a paper appendix or body. Also consider including uncertainties or sensitivity (if applicable) in the output. For example, if input parameters have ranges, showing how results might vary can elevate the analysis.

Interactive What-If Analysis: For design-oriented calculations like tunnel support, implement an interactive slider or input tool where a user can vary a parameter in real-time and see the result change instantly. For instance, a slider for “rock cohesion C” that updates the computed support requirements. While primarily an interactive feature, it can help researchers understand thresholds and could be used to generate findings like “beyond a certain cohesion, the required bolt length plateaus.” If such a finding is notable, they can capture that insight (maybe by exporting the interactive sequence as a static plot or noting the critical values).

All these improvements ensure that theoretical modules don’t just output raw numbers but provide visual and analytical context. The goal is that a researcher using these tools can directly incorporate the outputs into their work: e.g., include a figure of the support pressure distribution, or a chart from a parametric study, or a schematic explaining the calculation, all without resorting to external plotting software. This elevates the module from a calculator to an actual research aid.

5. General Integration and Usability

In addition to the module-specific suggestions above, a few cross-cutting improvements can make the whole system more effective for science and engineering work:

Consistency and Theming: Ensure a consistent visual style across all modules (2D plots, 3D models, maps, diagrams) so that if images from different parts of the software are used in a single publication, they feel cohesive (consistent fonts, color schemes, etc.). Perhaps implement a global “publication theme” that applies to every visual (e.g., same font and similar color palette for charts, maps, and 3D views).

Help and Guidance: Provide in-app guidance on how to use these features for research. Small “tips” or a guide (like “如何导出高质量图片” – how to export high-quality images) can ensure users know about the 300 DPI exports, SVG options, and so on. Similarly, guidance for the modeling module could suggest: “You can generate a cross-section by ... and use it in your paper’s figures.” This educational aspect will maximize the features’ use.

Testing with Real Use-Cases: It may help to test the optimized functionalities with a real research use-case. For example, attempt to reproduce a figure from a published paper using only this software. If any step requires external tools, that’s an area to improve. Strive for the scenario where a geology or mining engineering student can do their entire data analysis and figure generation within this one system.

By focusing on these functional enhancements, each feature of the project will directly contribute to research and production needs. The plotting module will produce figures on par with professional graphing software, the 3D modeling will yield insights (not just pretty pictures), the database will enable data-driven discovery, and the theoretical calculators will present results in an intuitive, publishable form. Implementing these suggestions will significantly increase the software’s value in a scientific context, making it a true all-in-one tool for researchers in mining engineering and geology.
